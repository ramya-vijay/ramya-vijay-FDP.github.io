# From Chalkboards to Chatbots: Faculty Voyage in AI

I had the opportunity to attend the Faculty Development Programme (FDP) on *“From Chalkboards to Chatbots: Faculty Voyage in AI”*, which was an enriching and thought-provoking experience. The sessions offered valuable insights into the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education, equipping us with both conceptual understanding and practical applications.  

One of the major takeaways was the exploration of a wide range of AI tools that support teaching, learning, and research. Tools such as **Research Rabbit, Connected Papers, Scite AI, Explain Paper, and Napkin AI** were introduced and demonstrated. The hands-on training sessions were especially useful in helping us explore the potential of each tool for enhancing research, academic writing, and classroom engagement.  

Another highlight was the discussion on **Agile Technology in Education**, which emphasized adaptability and responsiveness in teaching practices. The introduction to **Google App Script** was particularly new to me, and the way it was taught by the mentor made it approachable and applicable in my academic context.  

I also experimented with **participative learning pedagogy** with my students in Engineering Design. The activity was designed around the topic *“Need Metric Matrix and Target Specification.”* Students, working in teams of three, engaged in brainstorming exercises and collaboratively demonstrated their findings in the form of a dialogue. This approach not only enhanced their understanding but also made the learning process more engaging and interactive. Their ability to derive target specifications through teamwork and conversation was both impressive and impactful.  

For content delivery in my classes, I incorporated **Napkin AI**, which greatly supported me in preparing material more effectively. This experience reinforced the potential of AI as a supportive partner in lesson design and teaching.  

Overall, this FDP was a transformative learning experience. It broadened my understanding of AI-driven tools, deepened my awareness of innovative pedagogies, and encouraged me to adopt agile, technology-enabled teaching methods. The insights gained will undoubtedly help me enhance both my research practices and classroom delivery in the future.
